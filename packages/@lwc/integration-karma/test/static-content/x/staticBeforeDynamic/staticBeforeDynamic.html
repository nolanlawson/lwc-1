    <!-- The goal of this test is to have a dynamic vnode directly after a static vnode. We use a grab-bag
      of features that (as of this writing) are not supported by the static vnode optimization), while
      also including a large number of parts so that we trigger a full traversal in traverseAndSetElements. -->
